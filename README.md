# Satellite Image Segmentation using SAM

## Problem Statement

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for accurate segmentation of satellite images. Our goal is to identify and delineate various objects and regions within these images, which is crucial for applications in land use classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.

## Objectives

By leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM), we aim to:

1. **Automate Object Segmentation**: Develop a system that can automatically identify and segment objects in satellite imagery.

2. **Enhance Geospatial Analysis**: Improve the accuracy and efficiency of geospatial analyses through advanced segmentation techniques.

3. **Create a Versatile Tool**: Provide a flexible solution that can be applied to various image segmentation tasks in the geospatial domain.

## Key Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art SAM technology for image segmentation
- Processes high-resolution satellite imagery
- Offers customizable segmentation parameters
- Provides visual outputs for easy interpretation
